# Market Analysis with Collaborative Agents  

This project implements an agent-based market analysis system where autonomous agents collaborate to generate detailed industry reports. Using a modular approach, the system simulates a team of specialists working together to collect data, identify trends, and synthesize information into actionable reports.  

---

## How It Works  

The core of this project is the collaboration between three specialized agents, orchestrated by a "Crew" framework to deliver comprehensive market analysis reports. The process is divided into three main phases:  

1. ### **Market Researcher**  
   - **Role:** Collects and organizes relevant industry data, identifying key players, trends, and statistics.  
   - **Objective:** Ensure an up-to-date, well-documented data foundation.  

2. ### **Trend Analyst**  
   - **Role:** Examines collected data to identify patterns, emerging opportunities, and threats through in-depth analysis.  
   - **Objective:** Generate valuable insights to support strategic decision-making.  

3. ### **Report Writer**  
   - **Role:** Transforms trend analyses into structured, clear reports with executive summaries and strategic recommendations.  
   - **Objective:** Produce a final document that effectively synthesizes all findings.  

The program outputs a Markdown-formatted report, easily viewable and convertible to PDF for presentations or sharing.

## Technologies Used  

- **Python:** Primary programming language  
- **CrewAI/Other Agent Framework (implied):** For agent orchestration and collaboration

## Installation & Usage  

### Prerequisites  
Python 3.8+ required.  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Filip3Owl/Agents.git  
   cd Agents  
   ```  
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   # Windows  
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  
   # macOS/Linux  
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```  
3. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
   *(If you donâ€™t yet have a `requirements.txt`, create one with libraries like `nltk`, `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, and your agent framework, e.g., `crewai`.)  

### Execution  
To run the program and generate a market analysis report:  
```bash  
python main.py  
```  
*(Assumes your main script is named `main.py`.)*  

The final report will be generated in Markdown format in the project root (or a specified directory).

## Report Structure  

The Markdown report includes sections such as:  
- **Executive Summary**  
- **Industry Overview: [Sector Name]**  
- **Key Players & Trends**  
- **Opportunity & Threat Analysis**  
- **Strategic Recommendations**  
- **Data & Visualizations (if applicable)**
